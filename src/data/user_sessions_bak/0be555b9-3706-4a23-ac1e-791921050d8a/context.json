This session contains various information, such as your user ID, login timestamp, and expiration time. This session allows you to stay logged in and use our platform without having to re-enter your login credentials for each action. However, sessions do have an expiration time, and after a certain period of inactivity, the session will be automatically deleted from our database.",
